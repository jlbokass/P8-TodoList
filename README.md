In this project, i build a responsive todo-list app with symfony 4.3 and php 7.2. 

This work is done as part of my PHP web developer training with Openclassroom - project 8.

1. Run **composer install** to install the project dependencies.
1. Configure your web server to have the **public** folder as the web root.
1. Open [env.dist](/env.dist) and enter your database configuration data.

## Errors

If the `SHOW_ERRORS` configuration setting is set to `DEV`, full error detail will be shown in the browser if an error or exception occurs. If it's set to `PROD`, a generic message will be shown depending on the error.
